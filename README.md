# :pirate_flag: Treasure Hunt App :pirate_flag:
This repo is for the App used in Chase's Treasure Hunt.  
This is a multi stages treasure hunt based in Takapuna, Auckland, New Zealand.  
It consists of various riddles and challenges for the goal of finding the hidden treasure!  
You can view the app live by [clicking here](https://treasure-hunt-b8400.web.app/)!  

## :technologist: Technology
This is a Progressive Web App built in React.  
It uses Styled Components for the Styling.  
It's lightweight and doesn't use many libraries.  
To get it up and running just use the standard:
* `npm i`
* `npm start`

## :balloon: Contribution
Feel free to create any PRs for improvements.  
It would be great if someone was interested in creating additional treasure hunts for different places.  
That would involve creating an alternate `stages.ts` file with new stages.  
Potentially there could be multiple in the app and the user could select which one when they open it.  
Another idea that would be great to implement is customisable options when you launch it, for example:
* Duration
* Target Age Group
